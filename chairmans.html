    <div class="border">My Sophomore year I was interviewed and became one of three students chosen to be on the 4329
        LHS Roboteers
        Chairmanâ€™s Team. Our team's job was to represent LHS and the robotics team by creating and delivering a five
        minute oral presentation to judges, and then answering two minutes of impromptu questions. My team spent a ton
        of time preparing, and we had our presentation memorized so well at one point that we presented it while dancing
        to Cotton Eye Joe. Even though we were fully prepared, the real presentation was still nerve-racking. We
        competed against around forty other teams at the Saint Louis FIRST Robotics Regional Competition and finished in
        first place. Our win at the regional competition was the first in LHS history, and qualified our entire robotics
        team for the Detroit FIRST Worlds Competition. It was a significant growth experience for me and I'm so glad I
        was chosen to represent our school.</div>

    <div class="border">I've been in part of every fall theater performance since my sophomore year, As a sophomore I
        was only a stagehand, but my junior and senior years I've held roles. This year we are performing a play called
        "Game of Tiaras." Shows will be on November 6th and 7th, so please attend and enjoy! With theater I've also been
        part of improv club, and this year I've taken up the role of Vice President.

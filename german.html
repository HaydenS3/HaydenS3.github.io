    <div class="border">I joined German Club my sophomore at the same time that I was taking German. My junior year I
        ran and was elected to be Vice President. As VP I recruited new members, advertised meetings, and worked with
        school administration to schedule meetings and order club t-shirts. My junior year I also hosted a German
        student named Christoph. Christoph stayed with my family for two weeks while he went to school with me, and got
        the opportunity to explore the St. Louis area.

        <p><b>Info</b></p>
        <p>My freshman year I received the position of Software and Control Systems lead. When I first started in the
            position I had a lot to learn about leading a team, but as the years have passed I have grown into a skilled
            leader. During the offseason I teach my crew in Java using a curriculum I built myself. During the season I
            delegate tasks and maintain communication with other crews while defining a road map for the future. I try
            to
            give my crew the freedom to learn and grow on their own by stepping back while continuing to provide
            guidance
            and resources to them when in need. </p>

        <p><b>Other Accomplishments</b></p>
        <p>Created first software curriculum and coding ettiquitte. First student to write PID (Proportional Integral
            Derivative) control loops, vision targeting, and to develop
            swerve drive code.

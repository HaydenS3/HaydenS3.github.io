    <div class="header">Baseball/Umpiring</div>

    <div class="border">I've played baseball since I was five years old. My main positions are outfield and pitcher. In
        highschool, I played JV my Freshman and Sophomore year, and then made varsity my Junior year. On top of spring
        LHS baseball, I also play club baseball during the summer and fall. Whenever I'm not playing baseball I'm
        umpiring. I umpire for a recreational league, ages 7-14.
